"Many-faced god, I think it is the time to kill Cersei and take revenge for my father. I'm ready" Arya announced. "Do you have a plan? You know that Cersei is in the Red Keep, guarded day and night. A girl like you will never have a chance to get in there" Jaqen raised his worry. "Of course I do," Arya smiled and continued, "as long as I killed Jaime and got his face. So that I can enter the Red Keep without being noticed" "Good girl, be careful!" Jaqen patted on Arya's shoulder and said.

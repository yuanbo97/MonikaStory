"Many-faced god, I think it is the time to kill Cersei and take revenge for my father. I'm ready" Arya announced. "Do you have a plan? You know that Cersei is in the Red Keep Castle, guarded day and night. A girl like you will never have a chance to get in there" Jaqen raised his worry. "Of course I do," Arya smiled as she continued, "as long as I killed Jaime and wear his face. In that way I can enter the Red Keep without being recognized" "Good girl, be careful!" Jaqen patted on Arya's shoulder.

One month later at Red Keep.

"Welcome back, milord!" Saluted by the White Cloak guards, Arya tried her best not to laugh. As Arya halted the horse in the garden, Cersei went out and welcome her, "I miss you so much, my sweet Jaime! I haven't heard from you for a month. I thought you were... You didn't even tell me that you were to come back early." Arya held her sword tightly, which she named as "needle", and said:

"Even when we go away
Grown-ups come back

What about when mom drops me off at school
At the end of the day she'll come and pick you up too
Grown-ups come back

Grown-ups come back to you
Grown-ups come back they do
Grown-ups come back
Grown-ups come back

What about when mom and dad go out on a date?
They'll kiss you goodnight and they'll be there when you wake
Grown-ups come back

Grown-ups come back to you
Grown-ups come back they do
Grown-ups come back
Grown-ups come back"
